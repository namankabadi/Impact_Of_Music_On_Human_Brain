# 🎶 Impact of Music on the Human Brain  

## 📖 Introduction  
Music's universal impact on the human brain has been a constant across cultures and time.  
Recent advances in neuroscience have allowed researchers to **precisely measure how music activates every known part of the brain**, influencing **intelligence, happiness, health, and productivity** throughout life.  

This project explores the **profound influence of specific music genres** by comparing brain activity **before and after listening to music**.  
Leveraging **EEG signals captured through the MUSE 2 Headset**, the primary goal is to develop a **machine learning model** capable of discerning the nuanced impact of these genres on **human health** through in-depth brain signal analysis.

##  Mission  
The mission of this project is to understand **how music affects human health and well-being** through the analysis of brain signals.  

By studying the impact of specific music genres on brain activity, we aim to provide insights that can:  
- 🧠 Enhance **future research** in neuroscience and psychology  
- 🏥 Support **clinical practices** in cognitive and emotional therapy  
- 🎵 Enable **therapeutic interventions** in music therapy
